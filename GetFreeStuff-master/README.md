Problem Statement: Many young people find it difficult to make ends meet, at other times, well, who doesn’t like a freebie? Getting free stuff is something we all enjoy, but happens rarely. People have fixed budgets and fixed incomes, and sometimes don’t necessarily have the income necessary to enjoy the finer pleasures in life. This is where Free4u comes into play: an app which gives you the creature comforts we all want at no cost!

Application Name: Free4U

Short Description: People like to get free stuff and go to places. Our app combines just that. Basically we direct people to locations with social events, festivals etc. that offer free stuff and we give them an estimated value of how much free stuff they're getting. This helps people save money, stay in tune with the local community, and make sure that they are leading a good life.

Proto.io Design:

Class Design (description, UML, and Unit Tests):

Please refer to class documentation

(Please note that the UML Diagram was created before the coding began, some features were not fully implemented. The User Journey/Class Diagram is more recent)

Manual unit testing and debugging was generally carried out within the code regarding with the main activity, with it having code related to ensuring that logins are successful and work well. They also ensured that proper strings were inputted. In addition to that, an automatic unit test was carried out a Login Info class, which paralleled the activity for the login class. Both the manual unit test and automated unit test worked well and ensured the functionality of the shared preferences local database. The automated unit test is found under src/main/test.

Unique Feature of Application: Implementation of the Google Maps API Allows app users to see nearest free events nearby. Allows User to Scan for Events that might Interest them Project Summary:

Our app is designed to pinpoint the location of nearby freebies. The App, called Free4U, directs people towards social events, festivals, and other venues that offer free goods in real time and give an estimated value of how much the goods are worth.

At the beginning, we had some difficulties getting the project off the ground, but with some much needed guidance, we were able to succeed in getting to our goal of implementing the Google Maps API and making a functioning login system. We were able to come up with a good design for the project which we could work off of using Proto.io. This proved to be useful when we coded the actual app and made it work. At the end of the project, we had issues with implementing native unit tests for the android environment, so we went ahead and followed the PLTW lesson.

We could definitely go further with this project in creating a proper server side application for this app, and add many more features such as directions, reviews etc. and have it all stored in a database. We could also create an algorithm to determine the value of items that one could receive from attending one of these events.

Rishabh and Bharath were the main designers for the app, figuring out how the UI would look like, while Nikolai and Aakash went ahead and implemented code that would make up our application. Aakash specifically implemented the video and created the code for the structure of the login system. Nikolai implemented the Google Maps API and implemented sharedPreferences to store login information. Below here is the chart we used to keep track of tasks. Bharath in the meantime refined the proto.io prototype and gave feedback on the layout of the fragments and buttons.

Addendum to Project

In order to ensure the proper testing of the app on your own emulator in the Android Studio environment, please follow this guide in regards to setting up your development environment.
